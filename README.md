 Gene Expression Explorer

 Problem Statement

Gene expression profiling is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms, especially in cancer research. Public repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) provide valuable datasets, but researchers, particularly those without strong data science skills, often struggle to access, analyze, and interpret this data effectively. There is a significant need for an accessible tool that allows users to explore gene expression data, identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), generate synthetic data for experimentation, and visualize results through an intuitive and interactive interface.

 Proposed Solution

Gene Expression Explorer is a web-based application designed to address these challenges. It leverages publicly available datasets from GEO and offers the following capabilities:

 Retrieves and preprocesses gene expression data from cancer-related studies.
 Utilizes AI models (Random Forest + SHAP) to highlight important genes.
 Employs deep learning (autoencoders) to generate synthetic gene profiles for robust experimentation.
 Provides interactive visualization tools like volcano plots for insight into DEGs.
 Enables real-time gene search and charting via a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

 Key Differentiators

 Integrates AI-driven gene selection to provide biologically meaningful insights.
 Includes synthetic data generation through autoencoders, a feature often missing in similar platforms.
 Combines interactive visualization with easy navigation to support broader user engagement.
 Entirely built in Python using a modern stack, ensuring ease of contribution, deployment, and extensibility.

 Abstract

Gene Expression Explorer aims to bridge the gap between high-throughput biomedical data and user-friendly analysis. The project streamlines the workflow from downloading GEO datasets, performing AI-based feature selection using Random Forest and SHAP, generating synthetic data through autoencoders, to visualizing key genes with volcano plots. A dynamic web interface built with Streamlit supports interactive gene querying. This solution opens up genomics data exploration to non-technical users while offering advanced features for deeper insight.

 Existing Solutions

Existing solutions like GEO2R offer simple interfaces but lack advanced analytics and visualization. GEO2R, while easy to use and allowing comparison between sample groups, has limited statistical methods and lacks AI-based feature selection or synthetic data generation. BioJupies allows partial automation but does not offer synthetic data generation or AI-assisted gene prioritization.

 Technology Stack

The application is built using Python and leverages the following libraries:

 `Pandas` for data manipulation.
 `Scikit-learn` for the Random Forest Classifier.
 `SHAP` for feature selection.
 `TensorFlow` for the autoencoder.
 `Streamlit` for the web interface.
 `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization.

 Code Overview

The codebase includes the following key modules:

 Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: Downloads and preprocesses gene expression data from GEO datasets.
 AI-Driven Gene Selection: Employs Random Forest and SHAP to identify important genes.
 Synthetic Data Generation: Generates synthetic gene expression data using deep learning autoencoders.
 Visualization: Creates Volcano Plots and interactive charts to visualize differentially expressed genes and gene expression patterns.
 Streamlit Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for data exploration and analysis.

 Installation and Usage

1.  Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2.  Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the Streamlit application using `streamlit run your_app_name.py`.
4.  Access the application through your web browser.

 Sample Results

The application demonstrates the ability to:

 Identify top differentially expressed genes with interpretability scores.
 Synthesize data points for robust analysis.
 Generate volcano plots that visually distinguish significant DEGs.
 Allow users to input and view gene-specific data trends in real-time.

 Future Enhancements

 Automated extraction of condition labels using GEO metadata.
 Compatibility with single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.
 User-exportable results in various formats (CSV, PNG).
 Comparative multi-dataset analysis and feature aggregation.

 Conclusion

Gene Expression Explorer empowers users to navigate complex genomic data through AI-enhanced processing and visualization. It supports scientific discovery by making high-quality, interactive analysis available without requiring deep technical expertise. This approach democratizes access to transcriptomic insights, ultimately driving progress in cancer research and precision medicine.
